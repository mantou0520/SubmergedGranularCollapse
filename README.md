# SubmergedGranularCollapse

This work is for simulating the collapse of granular columns in a subaqueous environment with a really simple DEM model.
The simulation is conducted using MechSys, an open source multi-physical simulation platform (http://mechsys.nongnu.org/index.html)

The fluid effect is considered as lubrication forces (both normal and tangential direction) and Stoke's drag force in static water.
